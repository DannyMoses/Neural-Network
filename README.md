# Neural-Network
A basic neural network to build off of

To construct a "topology" aka the architecture of the neural network,
simple assign the vector<unsigned> to the vector of values you desire.

For example:

  vector<unsigned> topology;
  topology.push_back(2);
  topology.push_back(4);
  topology.push_back(3);
  topology.push_back(2);

will create a neural network with 2 input nodes, 2 hidden layers with 4 and 3 nodes, respectively,
and an output layer of 2 nodes

To be continued when I have more downtime in the lab.
